The jump trail is a great mishmash of jumps, burms, and mud in the Arcata Community Forest. Because it's not officially a part of the Arcata trail network, some great folks have been able to build some pretty great stuff. Don't let the name turn you away: there's always a path that goes around the scarier stuff, and so it is accessible to a wide range of riders. Follow with us as we take you on a ride down the trail.

There are many paths to reach the head of the trail, but we recommend climbing up trail 3 starting from the Redwood Science Lab.

At the top, you come onto trail #9, and to your left, the head of the jump trail awaits.

Before you go down, check out a group of trees right before the entrance: there's a decent jump to kickstart the exciting journey ahead.

The trail begins with an arena of jumps, featuring one with a giant gap but also some smaller ones for the newbies.

Continuing down the trail, there's an array of fun burms and massive, but avoidable, air-catching opportunities.

Around halfway down the trail, you arrive at a fork. The left leads to a series of S-turns and drops, while right cuts features a steeper downhill jump section.

Nearing the end of the trail, there are still an abundance of opportunities for some adrenaline-pumping moves, including one optional 8-foot drop that we can't fathom anyone does.

You come out on a over-logged road near HSU's Par Infinity disc golf course. The road splits: take a left to come back to the Redwood Science Lab parking lot, or continue your adventure to the right.
